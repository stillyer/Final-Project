  <p>My name is **Stewart Tillyer** and I am a second year MCP student at UPenn. My area of focus in the program is urban design. </p>

  <p>I am very interested in how the built environment is designed. My academic and professional background is in architecture, but I have always been interested in larger scale design of cities and the many dynamic systems that all cooperate to make them function, which is why I returned to school to study urban planning and design. </p>
  
  <p>My most recent interests have been in public transit design and transit oriented development. This interest developed this past summer while I was working in Dallas, Texas. My work primarily involved collaborating with Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the public transit agency for the Dallas metropolitan region, on a variety of transit related projects. My involvement with DART this summer is what gave rise to this project.
